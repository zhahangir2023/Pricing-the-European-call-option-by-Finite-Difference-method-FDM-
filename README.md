# Pricing-the-European-call-option-by-Finite-Difference-method-FDM-
This is the scientific project that was done by Zhahangir Zhumagali, for pricing the European call option by the Finite Difference method. In order to obtain the pricing results one shall run the file: Run_this_for_FDM_European_call_option.m with an appropriate choice of number of time and space grids. This project involves strictly a learning purpose with possible future extensions for more complicated nonlinear PDEs. However, I believe that this could be a good starting point for someone who wants to investigate this direction. If you would like more detailed information don't hesitate to email me.
